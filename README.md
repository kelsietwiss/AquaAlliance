# Name: Aqua Alliance Site

## -Project Overview-
Using Django, HTML/CSS, and Javascript, I am going to make a web page for my mother-in-law’s street’s Water Association. It is similar to a Housing Association, except that they are only concerned with managing the street’s shared well. It will have user login for everyone on the street, but permissions for only the President, Vice-President, and Treasurer to post to a public bulletin board when important news needs to be spread, such as scheduled meetings or when a water line had burst and the street had to limit their water usage.


## -Features-
#### User Stories
As an administrator, I want to be able to share important news quickly and easily because I want to keep everyone informed.

As a user, I want to be able to easily access important news about our well because it is a crucial part of our everyday lives.

#### Tasks
Create login for all members, with administrative permissions for leadership to be the only ones posting.

Create personal profile page. 

Create bulletin board for news/announcements to be posted.

Create calendar or list with upcoming events/reminders.

View for Water Association documents, such as meeting minutes.

Create member directory
